		SEE I Can Readâ„¢ children's books are designed to teach 3 to 6 year olds to read by themselves.<br>
		The concept was conceived as Cris Lindsey, President of Millennium 2000 Publishing Company, <br>
		was working with his daughter Sarah. He wanted her to be able to read her own mail when he wrote to her.<br>
		He created the books to give his daughter as well as other children a sense of independence. <br>
		The books were created using picture illustrations to form the sentences, with the actual words <br>
		written under the pictures so that the child can recognize the pictures and associate it with the word beneath it.<br><br><br>
