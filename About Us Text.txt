History and Credits

SEE I Can Readâ„¢ children's books are designed to teach 3 to 6 year olds to read by themselves. The concept was conceived as Cris Lindsey, President of Millennium 2000 Publishing Company, was working with his daughter Sarah. He wanted her to be able to read her own mail when he wrote to her. He created the books to give his daughter as well as other children a sense of independence. The books were created using picture illustrations to form the sentences, with the actual words written under the pictures so that the child can recognize the pictures and associate it with the word beneath it.
